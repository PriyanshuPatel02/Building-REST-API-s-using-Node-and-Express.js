# RESTful API with Node.js and Express.js

This repository contains code for building RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js. The APIs are developed to handle data from MOCK_DATA, with the main logic implemented in the `index.js` file.

## Features

- **Node.js and Express.js**: Utilizing the powerful capabilities of Node.js and Express.js framework for building scalable and efficient APIs.
- **Mock Data**: Using MOCK_DATA as a sample dataset to demonstrate CRUD operations and various API functionalities.
- **Modular Structure**: The code is organized into modules for better readability, maintainability, and scalability.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage resources effectively.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling mechanisms are incorporated to enhance reliability and resilience of the APIs.
- **Middleware**: Utilizing middleware functions for pre-processing requests, authentication, logging, and more.
- **Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests are included to ensure the correctness and robustness of the APIs.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Express.js
- Any additional dependencies specified in `package.json`

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
# Install Dependencies:
cd your-repository
npm install



## Usage
Once the application is running, you can interact with the APIs using tools like Postman, cURL, or any HTTP client.

Example API endpoints:

GET /api/users: Retrieve all users.
GET /api/users/:id: Retrieve a specific user by ID.
POST /api/users: Create a new user.
PUT /api/users/:id: Update an existing user.
DELETE /api/users/:id: Delete a user.
Make sure to replace :id with the actual ID of the user you want to retrieve, update, or delete.
